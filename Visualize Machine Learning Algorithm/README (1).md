# 📊 TV Advertising vs. Sales – Linear Regression Analysis

This project demonstrates a simple **Linear Regression** model to understand the relationship between **TV advertising budget** and **product sales** using Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and Plotly.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset `Advertising.csv` includes the following columns:
- `TV`: Advertising budget spent on TV (in thousands)
- `Sales`: Corresponding sales of the product (in thousands of units)

---

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **pandas** – data manipulation
- **numpy** – numerical processing
- **scikit-learn** – linear regression modeling
- **Plotly** – interactive visualizations

---

## 📌 How It Works

1. The dataset is loaded from a local CSV file.
2. TV advertising budget is used as the **independent variable (X)**.
3. Sales is treated as the **dependent variable (Y)**.
4. A linear regression model is trained to find the best-fit line.
5. An interactive Plotly graph is generated showing:
   - Scatter plot of actual data
   - Regression line showing predicted sales

---

## 📷 Output Visualization

The output plot includes:
- Blue dots representing real data
- A smooth red line representing predicted sales using linear regression

---

## 🧠 Sample Use Case

Marketing teams can use this analysis to:
- Predict how much sales will increase for each additional $ spent on TV ads.
- Visualize if there's a linear correlation between budget and performance.

---

## 📌 How to Run

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn plotly
```

Then run the script in your Python IDE or Jupyter Notebook.
